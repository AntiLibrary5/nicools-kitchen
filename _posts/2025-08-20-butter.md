I went to the supermarket to get butter and saw that it costs 3 euros, what in the inflation is that! so I bought creme entiere for 5 euros, sel de guerande for 3 euros and went back home and prepared my own butter. We don't joke around in this household!

## Ingredients

* 1L creme entiere
* Sel de guerande
* Patience
* Hand mixer


## Instructions

1. Empty the creme entiere in a bowl
2. keep whisking until after you lose patience, which is about 20 minutes
3. Once you see the milk fat is separated from its liquid (aka butter milk) stop whisking
4. Using your hands, or any other members, remove the fat from the butter milk and put in a bowl with ice cold water and ice cubes and start putting the fat into shape
5. Change your water and keep molding until your water runs clear
6. Once molded, put in a plate, add your seasalt and fold it in
7. Do the final shaping, wrap it in a paper and put it in the fridge
8. Store it for one week. I kept eating it for a month and nothing happened, so you'll probably be fine...i think
