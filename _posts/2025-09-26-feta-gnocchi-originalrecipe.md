People always tell me that they love cooking for others but when it comes to themselves, they eat whatever. I totally disagree. You deserve to cook for yourself a mindblowing meal, or at least I deserve it. That dish, I put together at 12 AM on a cold Grenoble night, the texture, the acidity, the warmth, the depth, the flavors, and everything in between, left me in awe. That day I knew that I'm "gifted". 

## Ingredients

* 1 feta block
* Gnocchi
* 1 big zucchini (3 medium lebanese ones)
* Handfull of cherry tomatoes
* 5 garlic cloves
* Red, green, yellow bell peppers
* salt
* a bit of Black pepper
* Olive Oil
* Harissa pasta (optional)


## Instructions

1. Put on your favorite playlist
2. Put on your apron
3. Put on your beautiful smile, girl
4. Put on your oven to heat at 180 degrees
5. Start by cutting all your veggies, actually no just the zucchini and bell peppers. Zucchini in thin slices, and bell peppers into strips
6. Undress your garlic cloves but don't smack them, nor smash them, nor grate them, leave them as they are
7. In a baking dish, put your zucchini, bell peppers (not all the quantity, eyeball it, but include all colors, shapes, and sizes) 
8. Throw in the tomatoes and garlic 
9. Salt them and be generous, salt is cheap
10. Pinch of black pepper, we don't want it to be overpowering cause we want to taste all the flavors
11. Drench them in olive oil and be generous, it's not cheap but you deserve to pamper yourself 
12. Mix mix mix 
13. Add your gnocchi, and mix mix mix mix mix mix mix
14. Dig a hole in the center of your dish, and gently place your feta in the hole
15. Bit of olive oil on your feta for good luck and to the oven it goes
16. Now tell me about yourself, we have 35 minutes to spare. 
17. Oh you wanna know about me? It was back in '07, did a couple of tapes, Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes, Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
18. Time is up, enough taking and remove your bakinf dish, it's 1 AM already
19. Now smash your feta girl, and mix the whole bake, until they all stick together, because together, we're always stronger 
19.1. While mixing, you can add the optional harissa squeeze and continue mixing. 
20. Put on Mylène Farmer, Appelle mon numéro and enjoy your gnocchiiiii
