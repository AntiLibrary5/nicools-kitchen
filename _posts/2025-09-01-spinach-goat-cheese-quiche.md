It was weird spending my first Christmas alone in Grenoble, away from my family. So I invited all my friends who don't celebrate Xmas, to celebrate Xmas with me. I wanted to make something very lebanese, and what's more lebanese than a french quiche prepared by a lebanese? Everyone approved, of my spinach quiche, except my mom, because she wasn't there to try it. 

## Ingredients

* 3 Big white onions
* Pâte brisée
* Olive oil
* salt
* Black pepper
* Thyme
* Spinach (frozen or fresh)
* 1 garlic clove
* 5 eggs
* 40cl Crème fraiche
* Fresh figs (or dried figs if out of season)
* Goat cheese straight from the Greatest Of All Time
* 5 Sundried tomatoes
* Hot Honey (check recipe under Add Ons)




## Instructions

1. To get into XMAS mood, put on some Fairuz christmas carols
2. Put on a XMAS Tree, and on the tree put on a photo of you with a XMAS Tree, and on the XMAS tree in the photo, there should be a photo of you on that Tree
3. Dice our onions, because what is mine is yours ;) 
4. In a pan, add olive oil, our onions, salt and let the onions caramelize slowly, it may take hours, but it's fine it's Xmas
5. In parallel, chop your sundried tomatoes
6. Cook the spinach with olive oil, salt, the garlic and sundried tomatoes until they're cooked, you're cooked, we're cooked, and I'm cooked
7. Heaven is a place on earth with you, tell me all the thing you want to do......baby now you doooooo....Ok so where were we? Onions? Sorry I am distracted by both Lana del Rey and Billi Eilish singing
8. Crack 5 eggs, whisk them with thyme, black pepper, salt and creme fraiche
9. In a pie mould, place your Pâte brisée
10. Add a layer of your caramelized onions, and then add your spinach and sundried tomatoes mixture
11. Pour your whisked eggs and make sure the whole quiche is covered
12. Put your goat cheese pieces and your figs on top and Op, in the oven it goes 
13. I would say put it on 180 degrees for 35 minutes, anw you can check yourself, I don't have to be precise, by the end of the day no one is paying to do this! 
14. Once done drizzle some hot honey, and enjoy ma bichette la quichette.
