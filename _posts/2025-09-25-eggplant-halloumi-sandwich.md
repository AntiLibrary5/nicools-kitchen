Yes, so I'm that girl who just came back home after living abroad for twen...two years. Of course I'm better than everyone in my village. Of course I'm mysterious and cool and SOOO phisticated. And to make my villagers compatriots see how mysterious I am, I took my tote bag to the mini market next door, and bought 1 eggplant, 1 tomato, 1 onion, and the smallest halloumi block. Two weeks later, and mom can still not leave the house out of shame.  

## Ingredients

* 1 eggplant
* 1 red tomato
* Halloumi Cheese
* Rocket leaves me alone
* Pesto not rosso
* Pickled onions (check the recipe on by blog you idiot) 
* That's it 
* Shit I forgot.....panco bread crumbs
* Salt and BP
* Olive Oil, how did I forget about you, forgive me darling
* Corn starch (you'll see why)
* Some buns hun


## Instructions

1. Get in your car and go to the nearest spinneys 
2. Flex your tote bag, and please don't use plastic bags, we're in 2025, respect the planet
3. In your tote bag, place all the ingredients and get the helloumi out of there, don't pay because fuck the paytriarchy
4. Once home, I always start by prepping everything, so it's easier towards the end of times
5. Slice your tomatoes, salt them and put them aside
6. Wash your rocket leaves and leave the to be as dry as you
7. Cut your halloumi into 1 cm thick slices, and if you're reading this from the U of S of A, 1 cm is 0.393701 inch
8. Cut the eggplants into slices as thick as you
9. In a bowl, mix some corn starch and water to make a sticky liquid 
10. In another bowl, mix breadcrumbs, salt, black pepper and OO7 (Olive Oil and the number 7 which makes completely no sense) 
11. Focus with me now, do I look good? aw than me!
12. Back to the recipe now, eggplant slide then cornstarch mixture then breadcrumbs, tac tac tac and repeat till your out of one of the three components
13. Eggplants in the oven, or in the airfryer that I bought just yesterday
14. Halloumi in a pan with some olive oil to caramelize into hazel eyes
15. Assembly general: Bun > Pesto > Rocket > Halloumi > Egglplants > Tomato > Pickled Onions > Bun 
16. Easy no? If my mom loved it, then you'll love it two
