Yesterday I payed a revisit to the tartiflette, a dish I adore, and made another dish that has nothing to do with it. But who are you to tell me not to call it "Tartiflette revisitÃ©e"

## Ingredients

* 650g pears, peeled and diced into cubes
* 200g white sugar
* 50g brown sugar
* 60g lemon juice
* 60g honey whisky
* half tspn vanilla extract
* 1g salt


## Instructions

1. Star by macerating (yep, that's a real word folks) your pears. Which means, for you illiterates, in a bowl, mix your pears, white sugar, brown sugar and lemon juice, give them a chair and let them sitdown for 1 hour. 
2. Add your macerated pears in a cooking pan, add your pinch of salt and cook for 20 minutes of medium heat, all while stirring every now and then.
*Every now and then*
*I find myself wondering about you baby*
*Seems now and again*
*I can't escape the thought of all that might have been*
*Every now and then*
3. 20 minutes in, mash your pears cubes with a fork and let them reduce for another 20 minutes. 
4. Add your whisky and vanille and simmer for another 7 minutes. 
5. Pour your jam into a jar, as clean as your are (just in case, this means a very clean jar)
6> Let in cool upside down, and then store in the fridge>
