I was back home one day, and was looking for ways to annoy my MOTHER. So I forced her to film me make a useless recipe, just like she...sorry YOU are. That recipe was your one and only lebanese burger, loved by many but hated by more. 

## Ingredients

* The thing you put in coleslaw....cabbage
* Mayo
* Potato for the fries
* Ketchup
* Tomato
* Onion
* Sesame bun
* Of course beef patties but the lebanese way ; mixed with breadcrumbs, 7 spices, and other stuff

## Instructions

1. Fry your fries
2. Cut your cabbage and mix them with mayo and a bit of salt, and here you have it, an easy tizi slaw
3. Put the patties on a baking tray and put them in the oven. Remember, it's a lebo burger, so cook the life out of the patties
4. Cut your bun
5. Assemble in that order : lower bun, ketchup, patty, tomato, onion, fries. Then empty the upper side and fill it with the slaw and close the burger. 
6. Kelo Khagha w sahten!!
