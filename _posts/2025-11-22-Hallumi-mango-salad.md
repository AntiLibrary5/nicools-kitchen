Last night, I came back from work with some cravings. Craving that my country becomes a decent country, craving that my people become decent human beings and not some hateful, racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic beings, craving that my cravings go away because I need to lose the goddam 20 kilos I gained. Ok tantrum is done, now I'm craving this salad. Trust me (actually no, don't trust me), but this salad is really good, you get this weird urge, that you can't wait to finish one bite, to take on the other. Was this too dramatic? Guess it was...
