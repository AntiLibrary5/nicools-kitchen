If you know me well (dw I don't even know me well), you'll know that I love to match my outfits with my food. That day I decided to wear a purple sweater for work, so obviously I had to match it with a purple pasta. The next day a threw my sweater. 

## Ingredients

* Half a purple cabbage
* Two red onions, but we're gonna call them for the sake of the recipe, purple onions
* 200g ricotta cheese
* Pasta and it has to be fusilli
* Olive Oil 
* 20g butter
* Salt and BP



## Instructions

1. Get the cabbage and shred it
2. Get the onions and moon slice them
3. Get the butter and put it in a pan
4. Get the olive oil and put it in the same pan 
5. Get your cabbage and onions and put them in the same pan with the butter and olive oil
6. Salt and pepper and then cover then pan and let them cook for 20 + minutes, until translucent
7. When the cabbage onion situation is almost ready, cook you pasta in SALTED BOILING water
8. In a food processor, mix the cabbage and onions, the ricotta, and 1 cup of pasta water
9. Blend until you get a smoothie like texture
10. Mix your purple glop with your cooked pasta and that's it (it may need to be watered down with some pasta water)
11. It's not bad btw, but like just not worth it
12. NOTE: for the people who love pink, add more parmesan and it will turn pink (dk how, why, what, when)
