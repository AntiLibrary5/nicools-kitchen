If you know me well, you know that my bff is chatgpt. One day I asked her if Gorgon Zola was Emile Zola's wife, and to my surprise, turns out that Gorgonzola was actually a cheese. So I thanked her and went on a quest to buy Gorgonzola and make something useful out of it. 

## Ingredients

* 1 block of gorgonzola
* 20 cl crème fraiche or cooking cream, nothing really matters
* Salt and Black Pepper
* Noix de Grenoble
* Jambon cru
* The Best pasta shape you can think of, I used Barilla Trofie


## Instructions

1. Salt the pasta water and boil the hell out of it (please don't add oil, it's a waste of oil)
2. Once the water is raving, add your pasta and cook to al dente (10 mins in that case)
3. In a pan, melt your gorgonzola cheese with the crème fraiche till your get a silky smooth rich creamy texture (that's a full list of all the adjectives I know)
4. Add a pinch of salt (gorgonzola is salty enough) to your sauce
5. Add a bit of pasta water to your sauce, and then add your pasta and mix it all together
6. Plate your pasta, add your jambon cru slices, crushed nuts and freshly cracked black Pepper
7. Put on your favorite netflix show, and try not to finish your dish during just the intro
8. Also try not to poop it out, it's so good it should remain in your stomach
