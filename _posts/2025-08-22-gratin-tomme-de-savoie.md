Yesterday I payed a revisit to the tartiflette, a dish I adore, and made another dish that has nothing to do with it. But who are you to tell me not to call it "Tartiflette revisit√©e"

## Ingredients

* Baby potatos, maybe like 300g?
* 2 garlic cloves
* 3 medium white onions
* 1.5 tbsp Brown sugar ;)
* 150g Tomme de savoie
* Olive Oil
* Salt


## Instructions

1. Start by brushing your teeth, that's the first thing to do when you wake up
2. Then wash your potatos and dry them well 
3. Cut your babies in rustic chunks, not tha symmetrical boring shit
4. Salt and oil your potatos really well
5. Crush your 2 cloves of garlic (DO NOT DARE TO MINCE THEM)
6. Move your potatos and garlic to a baking dish and put it in the oven on high heat for 20 minutes
7. In the meantime, cut your onions in half moons and start caramelizing them with olive oil and some salt
8. Half way through caramelizing, add your brown sugar, mix well and keep caramelizing (please don't burn them)
9. Remove your potatos from the oven, mix them well with the caramelized onions and put them back in the oven for 10 mns on a medium heat
10. Cut your cheese in cubes
11. Remove the potatos and onion from the oven, put the cheese on top and put it back in the oven for the cheese to melt
12. Once melted and all cheesy and warm and smells like heaven on a plate, eat it all for yourself, you deserve it girl
13. Don't share the recipe with anyone
