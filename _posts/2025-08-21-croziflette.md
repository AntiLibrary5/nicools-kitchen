January 27, 2024, If I recall...It was one of those dead cold days in Grenoble, and I was looking for a hug. Didn't know that you could buy hugs from monoprix for such a fair price. That dish, Croziflette, hugged my soul and my stomach, and ever since, I was officially named by the people's republic of Savoie "Ambassadrice de la croziflette". (This is a payed partnership between Me and the crozets).

## Ingredients

* 1 Box of Crozets de Savoie au Sarrazin
* 200 g of Lardons fumés
* 3 white onions
* 20 cl creme fraiche
* 1 block Reblochon de Savoie
* Salt and Black Pepper


## Instructions

1. Start by thinly dicing your onions
2. Preheat a pan, add some olive oil, your onions, your salt and start caramelizing your onions
3. Half way through, add your smoked bacon (Lardons fumés) and caramelize them with the onions
4. In parallel, boil up some water, and cook the crozets, they need a bit more than 15 minutes to cook
5. To your bacon/onion mixture, add the creme fraiche and some black pepper and bring it to a boil 
6. Now that the sauce is ready and the crozets are cooked, remove them from the heat
7. In the baking dish, start layering one layer of crozets, one layer of bacon/onion untill you're out of both of them
8. Get your cheese block, and cut it into two circles (imagine a tire, and you're cutting it to make two tires, you get the point right?)
9. Place your, now two blocks of cheese, on top of the pasta mixture, the crust facing GOD
10. Put the baking dish in a preheated oven until the cheese is all melted and the crust is golden brown (I'm drooling here)
11. Once broiled, remove from the oven, wipe your tears of joy, and indulge on this culinary experience
