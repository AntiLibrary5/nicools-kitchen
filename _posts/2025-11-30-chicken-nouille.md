Music to my ears:  نوي الغدا بكرا

## Ingredients

* 500g Fettuccine pasta (any other type is not to be used)
* Canned sliced mushrooms (don't use fresh ones for this recipe) 
* 200 g chicken breast
* 150g Jambon blanc or Jambon cuit or Jambon de Paris (they're literaly the same, I just want to flex)
* 200g shredded mozarella cheese 
* 60g butter
* 20g flour
* 720 ml whole milk
* Salt
* Black pepper
* Nutmeg
* Half chicken stock cube


## Instructions

1. This is literally the best nouille you'll ever have. No one swears by it, but belive me when I say so.

### Instructions for the day before 
1. Cut your breasts into cubes (the chicken breasts) 
2. Marinate them in greek yogurt, 2 cloves of garlic, black pepper, salt, 1 lemon juice
3. Leave them to marinate overnight
4. Go to sleep, you need it, you look tired, girl 


### Instructions for the Jour-J

#### The Mother sauce, aka The bechamel
1. In a sauce pan, add the butter and flour and cook well (don't burn the flour) 
2. Once cooked, add the milk, all at once and whisk heavily so it doesn't cluster 
3. Add Salt, Black pepper, nutmeg and the chicken stock cube and mix 
4. Let it cook until and silky, smooth, and rich consistency 

#### The Nouille
1. Remove the chicken from the fridge 
2. Cook in the airfyer for 10-12 at 180g (we don't want them to char because we want the chicken to taste suttle) 
3. So traditionnaly, the chicken is boiled, but I don't like the taste of boiled chicken, so I'm gonna give myself, and give you, the free will to do whatever you want with the chicken and with your life
4. Cook the fettuccine to al dente
5. Preheat your oven to 180 degrees
6. Cut your cooked chicken in smaller piece
7. Cut your ham into squares 
8. In the saucepan where you have the bechamel, add the chicken, ham, mushroom and pasta and mix well (it might need a bit of extra salt)
9. Move the mixture to the baking tray 
10. Cover with aluminum foil and cook for about 15 to 20 minutes 
12. Remove the tray, add the cheese and put back in the oven to broil 
13. Once the cheese is all melty and golden brown, remove and indulge 
14. Thank me now, beause I won't have time for you later...
