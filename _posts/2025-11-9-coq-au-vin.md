I hate using plastic bags. So today, at the supermarket, I put carrots in a plastic bag, and went to get a price tag from the guy, so he put the price tag on the bag. Then in the same bag, I removed the carrots and added leeks, so I don't use two bags, went to guy again to weigh them, and he added the price tag of top of the carrot's one. I was like hmmmmmm. I, then, removed the leeks, and the carrots, and added the onions, so then the guy put the onion's price tag on top of the leek's one. I ended up getting carrots, leeks and onions for the price of onion.
