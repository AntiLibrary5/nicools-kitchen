I just love and admire the effort I put into writing these description. Then, after a moment of reflexion, I realize that no one is actually reading them, so I double that effort, because I am actually writing that for me and not you, yes you **insert pointing emoji**. Anyhow, riz cantonais was an average dish made by average people. But history has changed on may 2025, when I first made the dish. It remained an average dish, but made by an extraordinary person... 

## Ingredients

* 1 cup of My smile rice
* Tuna canned in water
* Handful of cherry tomatoes
* 2 eggs 
* 150g feta cheese
* 6/7 cornichons
* 1 can corn 
* Handful of olives
* salt
* Black pepper 
* An enormous amount of olive oil


## Instructions

1. Wash your rice as if your washing someone else's sins, not yours
2. Now to cook your rice, you have to double the water. So cook the "mysmile" rice in 2 cups of water (should take around 11 minutes after boiling"
3. In the meantime...wait why is it called mean time and not nice time? it should be a nice time, when you're cooking. Wait are you enjoying or are you boring? 
4. So in the nice time, also boil your eggs, should take 7 minutes (as of me)
5. Cut the tomatoes into small cubes. Same for the cornichons and the olives
6. In a salad bowl, add the tomatos, corn, olives, Tuna, salt and black pepper and mix well
7. Add a generous amount of olive oil and mix well 
8. Once your eggs are cooked, also chop them over the tuna and veggiex mixture. 
9. Once your rice is cooked, leave aside for a couple minutes for it to cool off 
10. Add it over your everything (not your actual everything, but your mixture I mean)
11. Add a very generous amount of olive oil and combine well 
12. Crumble the feta cheese on top and serve 
13. Or no don't serve....just eat, you're already serving looks, girl.
