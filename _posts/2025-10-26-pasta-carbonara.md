If you want me to like you, make me a carbonara pasta. I like myself so much, I always make me a carbonara pasta. This dish will always remind me of Grenoble. So simple, yet so complexe, because if done wrong, it can quickly turn into scrambled eggs. Wait, that description got serious all of a sudden, unlike me....Anyway, go make yourself a good carbo, you deserve it. 

## Ingredients

* Abundance of pecorino romano
* Fresh black pepper
* 2 egg yolks
* Unlimited amount of Guanciale
* Pasta (tagliatelle or spaghetti)



## Instructions

1. Get your 2 oeufs bien élevées, unlike you
2. Separate your whites from your yolks
3. Just FYI: usually it's 1 yolk per person, but I eat for 2. Also, some people like to put 1 yolk and 1 whole egg, but I don't do that
4. In a bowl, put your freshly grated percorino, with your grounded black pepper and your yolks and mix well until hey form a paste
5. Cut your guanciale into small cubes
6. Heat up a pan, and cook your guanciale until crispy 
7. See that liquid gold that melted off the guanciale? yes, pour that on your cheese-yolk mixture and mix well and quickly
8. Bring water to a boil, salt it, and cook your pasta to al dente
9. In the pan you used to cook your porc, put your drained pasta and OFF the heat, add your egg mixture and mix well with the pasta
10. SO here, you have to be quick because we want the eggs to stay creamy and not become scrambled 
11. Once your sauce is all creamy, add your guancialy, give it a quick mix on low heat and tadaaaa girl 
12. Serve in a plate with extra pecorino 
13. Kudos to you (yes, I'm a strava girl now....), you just logged a recioe for the books!
