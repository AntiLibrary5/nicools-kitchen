Men belong in the trash but NOT Food. I hate throwing away food, and especially if it's good lebanese tomatoes. So here I was, on a saturday morning, contemplating about my life, all the decisions I've taken the past 28 years of existence, how Miley Cyrus and I look the same, and what to do with my tomatoes that are dying right in front of me. So I womanned up, put my favorite jam and decided to turn my tomatoes into jam. 

## Ingredients

* 1 kilo of diced and peeled tomatoes
* 1 cup brown sugar
* Grated fresh ginger (size of half a thumb...not a baby thumb) 
* 1 cinnamon stick 
* Juice of 1 lemon
* Between half and 1 teaspoon of salt
* Chilli flakes, depending of how hot you like them



## Instructions

1. Wake up at 5 am and be productive girl, or don't, just do you!
2. Open that fridge drawer you forgot existed, see that sad plastic bag, all sweaty in the back? yep, these are your tomatoes. Get them 
3. Wash the tomatoes (or don't, we're gonna peel them anw) 
4. Peel your tomatoes, remove the core (you know, that white hard thing in the middle, EW) and cut them into big chunks
5. In a mixing bowl, put all of the above ingredients, mix them well and let them sit for at least 1.5 hours. 
6. So, due to my short attention spam, I forgot about them, and let them sit for 6 hours. 
7. Sitting for 6 hours, hurts the ass, the neck and the back, so I took my all watery tomatoes for a walk, to stretch and get some fresh air, before I cook the life out of them 
8. Heat up your pan, and pour your tomatoes and on a low to medium heat and let them cook, while stirring every now and the (I get a little bit lonely....turn around)
9. After 1 hour and like 20 minutes, you'll see based on the consistency, remove them from the heat, put them in a jar and here you have it...the best jam to ever exist (the best jam to ever exist is any Theodora song)
