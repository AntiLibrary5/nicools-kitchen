I remember that day, I had a conversation with a right wing french person and was so pissed, so I decided to vandalize their french croissant and make it Arab. 

## Ingredients

* 1 french croissant from Les Generations in Gre to be exact
* Hummus (I will post the recipe one day, but not today)
* Cherry tomatos
* Pickled onions; check the recipe it's OUT
* Pickles or cornichon

## Instructions

1. Cut the croissant
2. Spread hummus on one side and rumours on the other 
3. Add your tomatos, pickled onions and cornichons on the hummus
4. Close the croissant
5. Eat
6. Repeat, because 1 was not enough
