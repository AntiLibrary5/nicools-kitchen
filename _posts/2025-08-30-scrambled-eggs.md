True story: first time I heard about Gordon Ramsay was a long time ago on Fatafeat. At first, I thought it was Gordon Ramzi, like Chef Ramzi, and started googling "Gordon Ramzi lebanese?", "Is Gordon Ramzi from Lebanon?", "Gordon Ramzi Lebanon", weird since day 1. Spolier alert he's not lebanese, but he has the best scrambled eggs recipe that I swear by (not that my opinion really matters). He taught me (and the whole fatafeat audience) it, and I'm just transfering knowledge here. 

## Ingredients

* 2 eggs
* a slice of butther (this big, you see?)
* A pinch of salt


## Instructions

1. Crack your two eggs in a bowl and whisk them. DON'T ADD SALT AT THIS POINT. 
2. Put your eggs in a cold sauce pan, on low heat, add directly add your butter. 
3. Keep stirring using a spatula. 
4. Still, DON'T ADD SALT AT THIS POINT. Salt will release the water from the eggs, and you'll end up with egg juice. 
5. Keep stirring on and off the heat, while keeping it on low heat
6. Once you get a "jello" like consistency, add your pinch of salt, stir for a bit on and off the heat
7. Once your eggs are creamy (all of this takes maybe 5 mins), remove from the heat
8. Lay on a toated slice of bread and eat it.
