I really think that me and vegetarianism can be a thing. That breaded tofu, went straight from the supermarket, to my bag, to the fridge, to the cutting board, to the airfrier to my mouth, to my heart. I think it was love at last bite. 

## Ingredients

* 1 block firm tofu
* Brioche bun
* White cabbage
* 1 tspn Miso paste
* Mayo
* 1 garlic clove
* Cucumber
* Rice vinegar
* Olive Oil 
* Bread crumbs
* sage
* Black Pepper
* Salt
* 1 tbsp Sugar
* Hot Honey (check my recipipi for hot honey)
* Corn starch
* Water


## Instructions

### Prepping the tofu
1. Cut your tofu in half and pat dry it please
2. In a bowl, mix your bread crumbs, a bit of salt, BP, a bit of dry sage, sugar and olive Oil
3. In another bowl, mix corn starch and water until they form a sticky paste
4. Now listen carefully, take your tofu, dip it in the corn starch mixture and then in the breadcrumbs, make sure it's fully coated
5. Repeat step 4 for the other piece of Tofu
6. Place your tofu in the airfryer (or in the oven if you're still old school, which is so cool gurl) for 12 minutes at 185 degrees until golden brown
7. Once out of the airfryer, put them in a bowl, throw an unlimited flow of hot honey on your crispy patties and make sure they become drenched in that sauce

### Prepping the slaw
1. Finely crush the garlic clove
2. Finely slice your cabbage
3. In a salad bowl (which is actually a regular bowl but we're making the salad in it), mix you garlic, miso and mayo
4. Don't add salt because miso is salty enough, just like you are ;)
5. Using your hands, like a real woman, mix your cabbage with the sauce, to make a slaw that goes down in history

### Prepping the Cucumbers
1. Using a cucumber peeler (which is a potato peeler but we're gonna use it for the cucumbers), shave your cucumbers into thin slices
2. Mix your cucumber slices with rice vinegar, and that's it

### Building the burger mister
1. Take a deep breath, because it's exhausting writing these recipes, for you!
2. Toast your brioche bun, I don't care how, just do it, you're a big girl
3. Then use your engineering skills, even if you don't have any and let's start building: bun, tofu, tofu, coleslaw, cucumber, bun
4. CONGRATS YOU HAVE A......B......URGER (dw not a boy)
