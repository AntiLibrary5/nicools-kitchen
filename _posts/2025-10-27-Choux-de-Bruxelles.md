When people ask me where do I get my sense of humor from, I always say my Dad. He's so lame, it cracks you up. Anw, our neighbour used to greet us by just saying "Chou?", and this used to fume my dad, like just say a proper Hello...So everyday, my dad would reply to his Chou? with Malfouf...So, in honor of my dad, I went to Bruxelles (no, I didn't), got some Choux from there, and roasted them.
