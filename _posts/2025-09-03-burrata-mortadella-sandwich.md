Today I hit a milestone! I ran my first 10km with Cecile. Am I becoming the girl who runs for fun? That's it for me? Who am I? What am I? Who are you? Why am I doing this? Why are you reading this? To answer all these questions, I made myself a sandwich to compensate for all the energy I lost running. 

## Ingredients

* Focaccia (pero yo tengo no tiempo para es)
* Mortadella (porc made)
* Burrata (cow made)
* Pesto (basil made) 
* Olive Oil (tree made) 


## Instructions

1. Get the best focaccia you can find, I got mine from Super Ravioli in Gre
2. Slice open your focaccia 
3. On one side put a healthy amount of pesto, healthy meaning a lot 
4. Layer a very so much super healthy amount of mortadella on your pesto 
5. Add you burrata ball and tear it open 
6. Drizzle a healthy amount of OO (short for Olive Oil)
7. Close your sandwich down and devour it
8. Don't share it with anyone....Except Cecile, she just ran 10k, she must be exhausted
