Guys that's it, people at work know about kolma3nikol and the blog, so I have to put my serious face in here. **Serious face inserted**. No I'm joking, always be yourself, even if yourself is an annoying human being who loves attention. Look at me caring....Back to the dish, yes I want to be the cool, gurl who just got back from France and is vegan, so I forced my mom into liking this roasted red pepper coconut milk chickpeas curry. 

## Ingredients

* 2 cans of cooked chickpeas 
* 3 red bell peppers 
* 2 red onions
* 5 garlic cloves 
* Olive Oil
* Salt and BP
* Chilli flakes
* 1 can coconut milk 
* No curry whatsoever
* A blender you shipped from Grenoble

### For the Kiri Naans

* La vache qui rit, hahahaha
* Flour
* Water
* Salt


## Instructions for the "Curry"

1. Disclaimer, these are express instructions, Danah and Jad are here and I have to go
2. Cut the peppers 
3. Peel the onions and cut them in halfs 
4. Peel the garlic 
5. In an oven tray, place the pepper, onion, garlic, submerge them in olive oil, salt and pepper and put them to roast
6. Ok, they're here, will continue that later....
7. I'm back, but drunk and tired....where were we? 
8. Once they finish roasting (about 40 minutes), put them in a blender with some salt, the chilli flakes and the coconut milk and blend them until silky smoooooz
9. Now in a pan, heat up some olive oil and then, after draining them, place your chickpeas and cook them in the oikl till they crisp up a bit 
10. Add your blended pepper sauce to the chickpeas, and leave to simmer together on low heat. 

### Instructions for the naan
