If you know me well (literally no one knows the next thing I'm gonna say, including myself), you know that my comfort food is baked potato, hard boiled eggs and hummus, eaten together. Since I'm not gonna teach you how to boil eggs or bake potatoes, because that would be concerning, I'm gonna stick to teaching you how to make a lebanese hummus. WAIT! It's just hummus because it's lebanese. 

## Ingredients

* 1 can chickpeas (you can soak and cook your own mais flemme)
* 1 Big lemon
* 0.5 cup of Tahini (don't get the bio tahini from the bio section at your bio supermarket)
* Salt and only salt, NO CUMIN, NO PEPPER, NO NOTHING
* Olive Oil
* Three ice cubes
* I don't add garlic to my hummus, or else I won't be able to store it for long. 


## Instructions

1. OK, don't tell anyone about this hummus secret that my cousin, who owns a restaurant told me about. Put your cooked chickpeas under a heavy flow of cold water, so heavy it should peel the chickpeas. Try to remove as many peels as you can, it will help your hummus be silky smooth. 
2. Drain your chickpeas and put them in your blender, or any blender, doesn't have to be yours.
3. Add salt, the ice cubes, a bit of olive oil, 3/4 of your lemon juice, and 3/4 of your Tahini
4. Mix the hell out of them until smooth
5. Get your finger, dip it in the hummus, then taste your hummus, to adjust the acidity or depth to your liking. PRO TIP: better to dip two fingers, because two opinions are better than one.
6. You hummus should be silky smooth, like your skin
7. Plate your hummus, drizzle some olive oil and serve it to the french, or the lebanese, or literally anyone, even no one, I don't really care. NEXT!!
