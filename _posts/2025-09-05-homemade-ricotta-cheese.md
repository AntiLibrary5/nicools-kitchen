I was partying hard on a Tuesday night, as usual, and by the end of the night someone screamed CHEERS, so I woke up the next day absolutely wanting to make cheese. Then I asked myself: Nicole which cheese do you want to make? If you're from Koura, you obviously now Ricosta, so in hommage to them, I decided to make ricotta. 

## Ingredients

* 1L fresh whole milk
* 3 tbsp white vinegar or lemon
* 1/2 tsp salt (optional)
* Cheesecloth or a clean kitchen towel or very old fanella Hanin

## Instructions

1. Pour the milk into a saucepan
2. Heat over medium heat, stirring occasionally, just before it boils, so basically look for gentle bubbles around the edge and a steamy surface.
3. If you can stick your fingers for more 10 seconds in the hot milk, it means it's good (not sure where I reaf this, so don't take my word for it)
4. Take off your clothes...No sorry, take off the heat
5. Add your lemon juice or vinegar , stir for a couple of minutes. You’ll see curds start forming almost immediately.
6. Leave them to rest in piece for 15 minutes, until the curds separate from the milk
7. Disclaimer: the milk will smell bad, like really bad, like baby vomit bad
8. Line a colander with cheesecloth or a clean thin towel.
9. Carefully pour in the curds and whey.
10. Let it drain for 10–30 minutes, depending how creamy or firm you want it:
11. Sprinkle salt over the curds and mix gently.
12. Congrats, you just made the best ricotta on earth, give yourself a pat on the back girl
