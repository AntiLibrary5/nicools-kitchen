It happened, I left Grenoble. I am currently in the sky and I am starving, and literally everything on the plane is sold out except for 1 sprite!! Can you imagine that? So I took the sprite, and took my laptop and decided reminiscing on this recipe, which blew my mind, Iris's mind, Julien's mind, Vee's mind and Cecile's mind. Mais quelle recette de ZINZIN. Also this was the last thing I cooked in GRE.  

## Ingredients

* Feta cheese
* Olive oil
* Zaatar
* Honey
* 2 Garlic cloves (optional) 

## Instructions

1. Get a baking dish or anything that can go into an oven
2. Place the feta block in that thing
3. Now if you want to take that optional garlic, then girl, I admire your exquisite tase. So take your 2 cloves and stick them inside the cheese, each clove on one end.
4. If you're not a garlic fan, than skip step 1, 2, and 3. Throw your feta, and go find a purpose. I'm joking girl, it's ok <3 
5. Drizzle an SG amount of garlic on your feta (SG, is for my homies in Gre, Société Généreuse)
6. Drizzle a good amount of honey all over your cheese. Feta, and honey go well together.
7. Sprinkle zaatar, prepared by your Aunty Marie or your Neighbour Jamila. Also, be generous with the zaatar, no one left and took anything with them. 
8. Put in a preheated oven for 30 min at the temperature you want, I choose a HOT T. 
9. Once you see the feta all caramelized, it means it's done. 
10. Serve it to your friends and see the smile drawing on their asses, sorry faces.
