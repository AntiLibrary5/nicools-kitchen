When I'm bored, my best entertainement is stalking myself on instagram, rewatching my stories, figuring out what was actually going on in my head at that time. No one, not even me, has an answer for that. While I was scrolling, I came across this dish, it was so unforgetable, that I forgot I made it. But, for the sake of adding a recipe here, I'll add my chicken over rice.  

## Ingredients

* 4 chicken thighs
* 250 g minced meat
* 1 shallot 
* 1 big onion
* Salt 
* Black Pepper
* 1 teaspoon 7 spices 
* 1 and a half cup of basmatouki rice 
* 2 cups chicken stock
* Olive Oil


## Instructions

1. Hey you ;) thanks for reading my blog. Now follow these steps and you'll end up with something
2. Ok so first (the row says 2, but it's actually the first step), anw, first, remove your thighs from the pack
3. No, no!! not these thighs...the chicken thighs...
4. Pat the chicken thighs dry, add a generous amount of salt and black pepper on both sides. 
5. In a pan, add a bit of oil, and char your thighs on both sides (3-4 minutes on each sides) 
6. Step 5 is essential because it will retain moisture in the chicken, so the chicken remains juicy, and will have this yummy charred flavour. We like yummy. 
7. Remove the chicken and in the same pan add the diced shallot and diced onion along with the minced meat. 
8. Add salt and spice spice spice spice spice spice spice
9. Cook until cooked
10. Add the washed rice and cook for a few minutes with the meat and onion
12. Add the chicken, and then add 2 cups of chicken stock 
13. Cook until cooked (rice absorbs all the water) 
14. I don't like the sauce that goes with it, so I eat it with laban. You do the same.
15. See? you ended up with a dish.
