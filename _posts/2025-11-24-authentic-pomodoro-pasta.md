If I never cooked for you, do I even like you? It's probable also that I cooked for you, but I don't even like you....It's just that I like cooking so much, it goes beyond you, me, and everyone on this planet and also outside of it. Speaking of that, do aliens actually exist? I should ask, what's her name, Katy Perry, she went to space for 7 minutes....Enough of that, let's make this gorgeous pasta, just like you are, girl.  

## Ingredients

* 4 garlic cloves
* Some really good cherry tomatoes 
* Salt 
* Fresh Basil
* Extra, really extra, virgin Olive oil
* Spaghetti Pasta
* Parmesan Cheese

1. People who don't eat garlic, who hurt you? Go get those 4 cloves of garlic, and I'll make you change your mind. 
2. Undress these 4 cloves and leave them aside
3. Cut your cherry tomatoes in half 
4. In a pan, put a goood amount, like really good amount of your extra virgin olive oil 
5. Heat it up a bit and then add your garlic cloves
6. Roast your garlic cloves until golden brown, we want to infuse the oil with that garlic, it's the best perfume any girl can wear
7. Once your garlic is cooked, remove it and add the cut cherry tomatoes
8. Add a hefty pinch of salt and cook on low heat 
9. In a pot, boil some water, and once it start boiling salt it (not before) and then add your spaghetti to cook al dente

11. Shit we almost forgot abount the garlic. Now, smash your roasted garlic really well and add then to the tomatoes and cook for a minute

13. Once the sauce is thick, add the drained pasta

15. Plate your pasta, and enjoy this simple dish
