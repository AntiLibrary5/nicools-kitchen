First time I had honey honey was over a pepperoni pizza in Sydney, at my mother's cousin (it's a restaurant and not actually my mother's cousin). Anw, the moment it touched my lips, my lips got burnt because the pizza was hot. Anw, the moment I first tried it, I called my mother's cousin, the one that lives in Sydney, and told her all about my hot honey. And now, 3 years later, she's always sitting in my fridge, not my mother's cousin...the hot honey.  

## Ingredients
