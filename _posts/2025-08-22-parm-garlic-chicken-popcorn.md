I decided to go watch Barbie at Path√© Chavant, so obviously I had to sneak in some snacks, other than me. What's more suitable for watching Barbie than garlic pamersan chicken popcorn? You literally don't need to answer that.

## Ingredients

* 500g chicken boobs, some weirdos call them chicken breasts
* Tony the tiger cornflakes, shoutout to my mom Toni with an e
* 2 eggs
* a handfull of flour
* 200g greatest parmesan cheese...wait I think it's grated not greatest
* 4 to 5 cloves of garlic
* A lot of french butter, maybe like 200g 
* chilli flakes
* Salt and BP
* Airfryer from fnac


## Instructions

1. First, go to the supermaket and get the ingredients
2. Cut your chicken breats into relatively big cubes and season them with a bit of salt and black pepper
3. Crush your sugar coated cornflakes in a bowl 
4. Whisk your 2 eggs in a separate bowl
5. Add your flour in a third bowl (yeah, that's a lot of dishes, MOM will clean it it's fine)
6. Focus
7. Piece by Piece (shoutout to the goddess Kelly Clarkson), put your chicken in the flour, then egg and then cornflakes and make sure each piece is fully coated
8. Place your chicken in the airfryer (no need to add oil because the cornflakes is oily enough)
9. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes on 185 degrees
10. In the meantime, crush your garlic really fine
11. In a pan, cook your garlic with a lot of butter and add your chilli flakes
12. Keep stirring until butter is well infused with the garlic
13. Once your chickens are ready, place them in a fourth bowl, add your garlic and butter mixture, your parmesan cheese and mix them well
15. Place them in the finest purse you own, put on your finest Barbie outfit and head to the movies
16. Once at the movie, enjoy your not so smelly chicken popcorn and try not to be kicked out
