No it's not Kofta, nor Kefta, nor Kofte, it's KAftA with As. When I turned "vegetarian" for 7 months (except for weekends, for outings, for vacations and for french tacos), this was the meal I craved the most. Gonna stop here, it's late and I'm out of words (yes, even extraordinary people get tired sometimes).  


## Ingredients

* 1 kilos of lean ground beef (5% MG)
* 0.5 kilo of lamb ground meat
* 3 onions
* 1 whole bouquet of parsley
* 1 jalapeno pepper or 1 red chilli pepper
* Big Handful of roasted peanuts
* salt
* Spice, Spice, Spice, Spice, Spice, Spice, Spice (7 spices) 


## Instructions

1. Go to the butcher and please don't get your meat from the supermarket, girl you can do better than that
2. Tell your butcher you want what you just read in the ingredients, I'm not gonna repeat myself because I don't have time for that you know? Really, my time is precious, and every second of every minute I'm working on something new, and repeating myself is not on my list of tasks today or any other day. 
3. If it's summer time (also assuming you don't have a car), then run back home before the meat goes bad
4. If it's winter time (also assuming you don't have car), then run back home before you're all wet
5. Once home, cut your onions smol smol smol, really very smol (or blend them but we don't want them to be really thin, or else it will become just water)
6. Mince your parsley
7. Mince your chilli pepper (leave the seeds for more heat, we like it hot)
8. Crush your peanuts into chunky pieces
9. In a bowl, mix your meats, with the salt, the 7 spices, the onions, the parsley, the chilli and the peanuts
10. Mix well with your hands, and make sure everything is equally combined
11. Roll them into balls, and freeze them in freezer bags
12. Next time you want to eat kafta, remove couple of balls from your freezer, cook them and ENJOY.
13. Thank me now and thank me later
