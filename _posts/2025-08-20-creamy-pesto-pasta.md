A quick little story about this dish. It's my go-to recipe for a busy weeknight when I want something comforting and delicious without spending hours in the kitchen!

## Ingredients

* 200g of your favorite pasta
* 2 tbsp green pesto
* 50ml heavy cream
* 1 clove of garlic, minced
* A handful of cherry tomatoes, halved
* Parmesan cheese for grating
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

1.  Cook the pasta according to package directions.
2.  While the pasta is cooking, heat a little olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
3.  Add the cherry tomatoes and cook until they start to soften.
4.  Stir in the pesto and the heavy cream. Season with salt and pepper. Let it simmer gently.
5.  Once the pasta is cooked, drain it (reserving a little pasta water) and add it to the pan with the sauce.
6.  Toss everything together. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water.
7.  Serve immediately with a generous grating of Parmesan cheese on top. Enjoy!
