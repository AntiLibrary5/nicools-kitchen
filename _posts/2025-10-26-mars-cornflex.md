 It finally came, le 5 mars, the day everyone looks forward to, the day that is called MY DAY. For a person who claims not to like their birthday, I really talk about it a lot. So obviously on that day, I had an abundance of Mars, the chocolate, because obviously on that day I bought them in blocks of 5, for them to be 5 mars...So with the leftovers, I made a childhood delicacy, created by Tante Naufe, loved by everyone, and known by MARS CORNFLEX.

## Ingredients

* Unsalted butter
* Mars bars
* Plain Cornflex (which is cornflakes but in lebanese) 



## Instructions

1. Do that while no one is in the kitchen, or else, trust me, you'll have the judgy french looks all over
2. Peel your mars bars
3. In a pot, and on low heat, melt your butter and the mars bars 
4. Keepi stirring so that the chocolate (or is it actually chcocolate?) doesn't burn
5. Once well combined, and all glossy and shit, take them off the heat
6. Pour your cornflex on the melted mars and mix well well well until it has a block consistency
7. On a tray, place a parchment paper, and pour your mars cornflex mixture on it and spread it over the tray
8. Refrigerate it for at leats an hour
9. Enjoyt it with an insuline shot!
