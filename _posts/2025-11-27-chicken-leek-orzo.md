Tonight my neighbour called me, needing help. Her sink had a leak. She panicked and didn't know what to do. I panicked and didn't know what to do. I went home and I couldn't stop sinking about her leak. So I took the leak, cooked the hell out of it and made it into a terrific dish. Did that fix her leak? No. Did that fix my life? Also, No. So then what did it do? Well, Absolutely nothing.
