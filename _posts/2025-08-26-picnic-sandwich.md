I am so grateful for Mr Sandwich for creating that concept. However, when it comes to fashion, the sandwich effect is my ultimate nightmare. Bref, make yourself a sandwich and go hangout in the nearest parc, you deserve it. It's a plus if you have a Danah to take with you.

## Ingredients

* 1 burrata
* Bresaola
* Rocket
* Black pepper
* Honey
* Olive oil from Danah's hair
* Balsamic glaze
* Pesto
* Fresh Mozzarella
* Fresh red tomato
* 1 loaf of sourdough bread



## Instructions

### Sandwich number 1

1. Cut your bread and don't toast it
2. Spread honey on one side
3. Lay your bresaola, the more the merrier
4. Lay down open your burrata ball
5. Add your rocket
6. Drizzle some olive oil and some balsamic
7. Crack some fresh black pepper
8. Sandwich it
9. Take a bite for good luck, wrap it, put it in your picnic basket next to your IPA beer

### Sandwich number 2

1. A classic sandwich suitable for a classic girl, not me
2. Spread pesto on one side of your bread and be generous
3. Cut your mozza into thick slices and lay it on the Pesto
4. Cut your juicy tomato into slices, lay it on the mozza
5. Don't be tasteless, so salt, pepper and olive oil your tomatoes
6. Close down your sandwich and that's a wrap 
7. Now go to the parc, put on some music, enjoy your beer, your sandwich, the sun, the mosquitos and GRENOBLE baby
