So it snowed in Grenoble and I wasn't there. Won't lie to you, I got a bit emotional. I miss Grenoble so much. So, to handle it like the big girl I am, I decided to make the ultimate dish, from the Dauphiné region, un vrai Gratin Dauphinois, that puts La Ferme a Dede's one to dust. I made it using lebanese ingredients, and I made it on the lebanese indenpendence day, so excuse me France, I'm gonna call it, un gratin Nicolois.  

## Ingredients

* 5 heads of potatoes
* 1 Liter of milk 
* 2 cloves of Garlic 
* Salt 
* Nutmeg
* Black Pepper (optional)
* Butter, either homemade or Bordier Butter


## Instructions

1. Get in your car, take your sister with you, drive 5 hours and get potatoes straight from the bekaa valley
2. Get back home, bring your sister and let her wash the potatoes 
3. Tell your sister to peal the potatoes 
4. Let your sister cut the potatoes into really thin slices, just like potato chips 
5. Let your sister crush the garlic, but don't let her mince it 
6. Let your sister bring a big pot from the cupboard
7. In the pot, tell your sister to put the potato slices, along side the milk, and the garlic, nutmeg and a bit of black pepper (no need) 
8. Let your sister tell the flame to bring to a boil for like 10 minutes 
9. Tell your sister to put everything in an oven dish and put it in the oven for tooooooo long 
10. Advise your sister that it's better to cover it with aluminum foil so it doesn't burn 
11. Tell your sister that she needs to wait for about 2 hours 
12. After about an hour and a half, tell your sister to cut some butter and put it on top of the gratin and put it back in the oven 
13. Once the milk is evaporated, the butter is melted and the gratin is golden, give your sister the green light to remove it from the oven 
14. Let it reste for 10 minutes, but don't let your sister rest, she didn't do any effort 
15. Let your sister serve you the best dish on earth
