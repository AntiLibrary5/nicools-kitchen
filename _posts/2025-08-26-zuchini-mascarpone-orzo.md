Sometimes I look in the mirror and ask: How am I this great? And oddly enough, the mirror answers me, always having the same answer: "have you seen your cooking?". I have, but have you? So here's one of those dishes, that you could eat morning, noon and night I care about ha (not a shoutout to king charles)
