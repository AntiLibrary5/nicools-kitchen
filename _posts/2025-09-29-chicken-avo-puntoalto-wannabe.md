One night I was binge watching my turkish series and my 2yo kid came to wish me a good night...Then out of a sudden, her curiosity hit and she started asking those random question, like why is the earth flat? Why are vaccines bad? Why did they falsify the moon landing? Who was she named after?...Not bad for a 2 year old. So I looked her in the eye and told her "Chicken Avocado, it's time for bed, go sleep!"....Not being at school is ruining her!

## Ingredients

* 1 Avocado or if you're lebanese then 1 avokeydo
* 1 chicken boobies
* Panco Bread crumbs
* Grated Parmesan
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 tbsp butter, the homemade one
* Salt
* Black pepper
* Olive Oil
* Cooking cream
* 1 big potato
* 1 egg
* Flour


## Instructions

1. Go to Punto Alto and order the dish, but if you're extra like me, just follow my lead
2. Wash your hands, feet, teeth, hair, sleep tight and wake up early the next day to go to the farmer's market
3. Get some corn fed chicken. To make sure they were fed corn, ask the breats, they won't lie to you
4. Step 1 you say we need to talk, you walk you say sit down it's just a talk

### Quote me, the chicken said, as I lay her in the breadcrumbs
1. Cut the chicken breats into two thinnish slices
2. In a bowl, mix your panco, with a bit of salt, pepper and your parmesan cheese
3. Now quote your chicken "bak ba kikk", no actually coat it not quote it. 
4. In a bowl, whisk an egg, and then put your breats in flour, egg and then panco, repeat that for both slices
5. Shallow fry your chicken in some oil until golden and crispy (about 4 minutes per side)

### Avocado or Avocaydo, who cares? 
1. In a pan, heat up some olive oil and some butter 
2. Add your crushed garlic
3. Add your avocado, and some BP and cook with the oil and butter
4. Add your cooking cream and let everything cook together
5. You can crush your avos a bit, or you can keep them chunky as you like, or actually as I like

### Prep your potatoes
1. Cut your potatoes punto alto style (big cubes)...SKIN ON
2. Mix them with oil and salt and bake them for a lot of minutes

#### Uniting the Nations
1. In a plate, place your chicken, and place your sauce on top
2. Put the potatoes in the plate (why am I actually saying that???)
3. Call your daughter; Chicken Avocado, to come try the real Chicken Avocado first of her name
