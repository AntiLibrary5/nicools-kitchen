From the day I was born this way, my mom used to tell me that I'm "special", but i always thought that something was missing. Fast forward to November 2024, when I realized that what was missing was me being vegetarian. I threw all the meat in my fridge and decided to make these lentils meatballs for lunch. That day I had ribs for dinner and the rest is history.

## Ingredients

* 500g of green lentils
* Infinite g of parmesan
* Bread crumbs
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon Salt
* Black Pepper
* Thym de Provence


## Instructions

1. Start by boiling the hell out of your lentils until they're soggy
2. Drain your lentils, really well and put them in a bowl
3. Add the salt, pepper and thyme and start smooshing the lentils with your hand until they form a paste (yep, quite disgusting) 
4. Add a handfull of breadcrumbs to suck up all the moisture
5. Add your tomato paste and your parmesan
6. Keep smooshing the mixture until you have a doughy texture
7. Shape them into BALLS, put them in a freezing bag, put them in the freezer and just forget about them. 
8. Get some lebanese bread or a tortilla wraop
9. Spread a harissa mayo on it
10. Add tomatos and pickles to your wrap
11. Finish my adding the air fried balls, or fried, or just panned, I don't really care how you cook them
12. And that's a wrap, or as the french would say: that's a Vrap
