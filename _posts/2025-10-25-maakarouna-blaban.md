I always cringe when people call lebanese "pasta" PASTA. Like no, we all know you call it Maakarouna at home, so please, put that heavy social weight you carry aside and don't call me baby, call me habibi. It's universally known as Maakarouna bi Laban. Plus, it's the end of the month, I have two dollars left, I made this dish because it's the cheapest option, so no it's not pasta ma biche. 

## Ingredients

* 1.5 cup of Laban or if you're in Grenoble, Laban is Fromage blanc 
* 2 garlic cloves 
* Olive Oil
* Dried mint or some zaatar (for a twist)
* Salt
* Pine nuts (optional) 
* Shit almost forgot the Maakarouna (preferably spaghetti nb 5) (it's Mambo number 5)



## Instructions

1. Girl, Bring your water to a boil, salt it and once boiling add your spaghetti
2. Girl go crush some hearts and then proceed by crushing the garlic
3. As we say in lebanon "kele toum wa ensse l hmoum", eat that garlic, girl
4. In a bowl, mix your laban, garlic, salt, and a drizzle of olive oil (if you're using dried mint, throw it in here girl)
5. In the meantime, in a pan, heat up a bit of olive oil, and fry some pine nuts or any nut you want
6. Girl, keep an eye on the Maakarouna, we want it al dente
7. Once al dente, drain your pasta, but don't drain yourself girl, relax, nothing is worth it 
8. While still hot, mix your Maakarouna with your garlic-laban situation
9. Add a drizzle of olive Oil
10. Throw some zaatar for decoration because we live in a sad nation
11. Throw in your pine nuts girl 
12. Take yourself to the sofa, choose your favorite show to watch, and enjoy your pa....Gotcha, Maakarouna.
