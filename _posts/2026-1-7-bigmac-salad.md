I haven't eaten MacDonalds since October 2023, but hadn't been to the branch next to my house since 2018, ever since I lied to them about being left-handed to win a prize and they found out about it. It also happened to be Jan first, the day I start my diet every year. So it was the obvious choice to make a Big Mac Salad, something refreshing and crunchy on a cold winter day. 

## Ingredients

* Roman Lettuce and a lot of it
* 3 Lebanese pickles
* Half a big onion or 1 medium onion
* 2 medium potato heads
* 300g extra lean minced beef
* 150g greek yogurt or labne
* 1 teaspoon mayo
* 1 teaspoon whole grain mustard
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* Salt
* Black pepper
* Paprika
* Pickle juice
* Sharp Cheddar or Parmesan Cheee


## Instructions

1. Stop Having Macdonals, you can prepare it home for more expensive, not better but for a clearer conscience
2. Dress well ti prepare the dressing first
3. In a small bowl, mix the labne, mayo, mustard, sugar, salt, black pepper, paprika, and pickle juice and mix well
4. Let the dressing rest, at least she can get some, not like you girl. Why so tired? go rest!
5. If Hell exists, then that's a task from Hell: washing the lettuce. Like I want to hve salmonela, leave me alone lettuce, I don't want to wash you, you dirty piece of shit. 
6. After washing away your lettuce and your feelings, dry them both really well. 
7. Cut your potatoes into small cubes and cook them in a pan with a bit of olive oil, until golden crispy
8. In another pan, cook your minced with just salt and black pepper 
9. Dice your pickles and onions 
10. I'm tired and you the drill, mix everything together now.
11. If you have some cheese, shave some cheese on top. If not, then don't shave some cheese on top.
