I was complaining to my cousin Rachael that lives in Dubai Mall, shoutout to her, that I was hungry. She told me to make this sardine pasta. I took her average advice and made it into a sublime dish, gorgeous, just like you are, yes, I'm quoting the pasta queen, and no she doesn't care.

## Ingredients

* Soba noodles, and if you don't know what these are, don't talk to me
* 2 cans OLIVE OIL sardines
* Olive Oil
* Half a lemon
* Panko bread crumbs, or tbh any bread crumbs
* 3 garlic cloves
* olives
* chilli flakes

## Instructions

1. Drain the sardine oil in a pan, fry your panko until golden brown and set aside
2. Cut your gralic smol smol smol, actually in thin layers, dk the technical word for it
3. Cut your olives in circles 
4. In the same pan that you used in step 1, add olive oil, your garlic and olives and salt and black pepa.... oh and the chilli flakes
5. Sautee together until like they smell goood, and your kitchen smells like garlic, but be carefull not to have laundry around
6. Now cook the soba noodles, and chillax, they only take 4 minutes to cook
7. In parallel, or no, In perpendicular, add the sardines to the garlic olive oil and mix together and then add the half squeeze of lemon
8. Once the pasta is cooked, toss it in the sardine mixture and mix for like 30 seconds 
9. Plate your pasta and then add your panko crumbs 
10. Or you can get yourself a Nikol and she'll cook it for ya!
