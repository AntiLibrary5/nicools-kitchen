Everytime I say something so random, people often tell me that they wonder what goes on in my head when I say stuff like that. To be hoenest, I have no idea what goes on up there and I think that's beautiful. Like right now, I just left my PC and went to make some popcorn but ended up doing instant noodles. I am totally fine, right? Right, girl, you are fine ;)
