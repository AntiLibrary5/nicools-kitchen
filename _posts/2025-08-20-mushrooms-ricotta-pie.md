On a hot canicule day in Grenoble, I was craving something refreshing. What's more refreshing that cooked mushrooms, with truffle whipped ricotta on a flaky crust, cooked to golden brown in a steaming hot oven? well, anything is more refreshing than that!

## Ingredients

* Puff Pastry roll
* Ricotta Cheese
* Truffle oil
* 300 g Swiss Mushrooms because they're cheap
* 1 Shallot
* 1 tooth of garlic 
* fresh thyme 
* White wine
* 1 egg for the wash

## Instructions

1. Cut the mushrooms
2. Put olive oil in a pan and cook your shallots, mushroom and 1 tooth of garlic
3. Add butter and your fresh thyme because I don't like rosemary
4. Cook them together and then add white wine and let it reduce 
5. whip the ricotta with salt and truffle oil because i cannot afford real truffle
6. Spread your cheese on the puff pastry and add on top of it your shrooms
7. Do an egg wash for the edges for that shiny golden retriever....color
8. Put in the oven until cooked
0. PREHEAT YOUR OVEN GURL or boy...
