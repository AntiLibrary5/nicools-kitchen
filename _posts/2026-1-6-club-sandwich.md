Combine my two favorite things on earth and it will definitely not be a Club Sandwich. But girl this one was good. It's been literally 10 years since I had once, and I will probably wait 10 years till I have another one. I'm messing ya, it was delish like billie eilish. 

## Ingredients

* 3 slices of pain de mie
* 2 eggs 
* 1 chicken bretz
* 2 slices of bacon
* 2 tomato slices
* 1 piece roman lettuce (NOT ICEBERG)
* 2 tbsp mayo
* 1 tspn moutarde a l'ancienne
* Salt and BP
* Half Clove of Garlic 
* Lemon Zest

## Instructions

1. Someone told me that it must've been hard building the eifel tower, so I challenged them into building a bread tower
2. Take off your rings, your watch, your bracelets and the mask that you sometimes put, wash your hands and let's get to work 
3. Start by cutting your chicken breast into a butterfly (that's the actual metamorphosis of a butterfly: worm > butterfly > chicken > butterfly)
4. Choose your favorite season, mine is winter, and then season your butterfly with salt and pepper ON BOTH SIDES
5. Oil up a non-stick pan, or a stick one, if you're cheap and poor like me, heat it up and then place your butterfly
6. Cook your butterfly 3-4 minutes on each side and she'll be alive again
7. In parallel, or as my mathematicien dad would say: In perpendicular, boil your 2 eggs. I like mine overcooked, and I really don't know, nor care, how you like yours.
8. In perpendicular as well, make your mayo spread: mayo + mustard + salt + BP + Garlic + Zest = mayo spread
9. Once your chicken is cooked, obviously remove it off the heat, same goes for the eggs, girl
10. Chop your eggs (but not thinly, we want them chunky) and then mix them in a good big tablespoon of your mayo spread
11. Salt your tomato slices or else they would be tasteless like most people you know
12. Toast our bread in a toaster. But if you're cheap and poor, unlike me, you can toast the bread in your stick pan, in that case. 
13. In the same pan, cook your bacon
14. Now for the assembly, start with calling your "friend" to show them that you can build a tower better than the Eifel tower
15. Now repeat after me: Bread, Mayo, Eggs, Bacon, Bread, Mayo, Chicken, Tomato, Lettuce, Bread, khet 7arir 3a 7et Khalil 
16. And here you have it girl, a perfect club sandwich 
17. Now go eat it while you watch "Hello Government" or "Salut Etat" if you're a frenchie.
