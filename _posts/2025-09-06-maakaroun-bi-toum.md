This recipe hit me hard and soft. Last recipe I filmed in Grenoble :( I wanted this it to be something big, like a Magret de Canard or some saucisse de Lyon, but actually turns out that flour, water and garlic were what my heart and soul needed. Maakaroun bi toum, you have my heart is it love or is it art? Probably fart, because garlic makes me gasy. 

## Ingredients

* Flour (eyeball it)
* Yeast
* Olive Oil
* Salt
* Lukewarm water
* 1 whole garlic 
* Lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Make your dough by mixing together Flour, yeast, salt, olive oil, and the lukewarm water
2. I swear to Lady Gaga I don't have exact measurements, I just feel the dough and connect with it on a deeper level. You know? you should treat your dough with love and care, and not limit it to measurements??? She has feelings you know??
3. Ok, rent is over. 
4. Shape your dough into a ball, cover it with olive oil 
5. Cover you dough with a sheet, put it to sleep for 2 hours.
6. Gently wake your dough up, and then separate it into small pieces, like gnocchi size and give them the shape you want. 
7. Boil some salted water, straight from the Mediterranean Sea and cook your pasta balls for about 10 mns or until fully cooked (not sure how long to be hoenest)
8. In parallel, crush garlic with olive oil and lemon and let them emulsify a bit (I use fancy words becaue I'm very phisticated)
9. Once your dough is cooked, starin it and move it to a bowl (while leave some of that pasta water)
10. Add your crushed garlic on top, and mix until you're out of breast...sorry breath.
11. Enjoy your meal and girl, don't worry about having a garlic breath, just do you and eat that garlic gurl.
