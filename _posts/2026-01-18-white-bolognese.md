I am writing my white bolognese recipe, insipired by NYT Cooking, while watching California Girls by Katy Perry on Youtube, drinking my diet pepsi after a long day of scrolling on Instagram. It's sad how we have become. While I go wash away the white in me, go prepare this white bolognese. And yes, white bolognese is actually a thing.

## Ingredients

* 1 big white onion
* 2 medium carrots 
* 2 lebanese courgettes
* 1 cup white wine 
* 1 beef stock cube melted in two cupas of simmering water
* 500 g coarse minced beef 
* 200 ml cooking cream
* 500 g pasta shells
* freshly grated Père Mesan
* Salt
* Black Pepper

## Instructions

1. Let's start with a riddle: What's hotter than an italian saying 'OK'?... A lebanese making an italian dish way more than OK.
2. Girl, first start... sorry got distracted by Justin Timberlake's timeless song "Mirrors"
3. OK back to Biz, so girl, start by washing your hands, then washing the veggies and then rewashing your hands in order to retouch the veggies. 
4. Brunoise the onion, carrots and zuchini (yes, I'm sooooo phisticated and I use very phisticated words as well) 
5. Now sweat your brunoise, but please don't sweat yourself (also sweating food, means cooking it slowly in olive oil until tender)
6. Five minutes after your brunoise has been cooking, add a pinch of salt and black pepper 
7. Add your minced to the pan and let them brown. Break the minced beef down while cooking. 
8. Lower the heat and add your 1 cup of white wine and let it simmer until the wine is moslty evaporated. Making it Halal for you. 
9. Once you ask yourself Wayn El Wine? You can safely add your bouillon. Only add 1.5 cups and let it cook off, untill almost fully evaporated as well. 
10. Once it is considerably reduced, add the remaining half cup of bouillon
11. Never Forget: Salt and Pepper 
12. Now in Parallel. start cooking your pasta shells. You can use orecchiette, which is the ultimate pasta shape, but they were more expensive and I'm still surviving on Xmas' leftovers. 
13. Add your cream to your Ragù and let it cook 
14. Remove your pasta couple of minutes before al dente and let it continue cooking with the Ragù, while adding 1 cup of pasta water. 
15. Once the sauce is thickened and the pasta is cooked, your white bolognese is ready. 
16. Spoon yourself a serving and grate some parmesan for that extra quick, because you're extra, girl. 
17. Now come give me a pat on the back to congratulate me on making this dish extraordinary....
