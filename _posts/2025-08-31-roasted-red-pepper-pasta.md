From the outside this pasta might look super basic, a red tomato pasta, unseasoned, prepared by a white person. However, when you dig into it, this pasta is full of flavors, actually extraordinary. Wait a second...Is this pasta me??? Am I better than everyone? (saying it in Julien's voice)

## Ingredients

* 3 red bell peppers
* 1 whole garlic
* 1 tbsp Miso paste
* 200 ml coconut milk 
* Salt
* Black pepper
* Chilli flakes
* Tagliatelle pasta



## Instructions

1. Cut your peppers in halfs, or in like big pieces
2. Peel your garlic cloves, the whole thingy 
3. Place your peppers and garlic on a baking sheet, drizzle huge amount of olive oil, salt and black pepper
4. Roast for 30 mins: yeah red pepper, you wannabe tomato, no one likes you, you know??? no one is Making a bloody Mary out of you!!! you're useless
5. When you're done roasting, remove them from the baking tray and put them in a blender with all the oil in the tray
6. I don't peel the peppers because it annoys the hell out of me, but if you can, girl, go for it, peel your peppers after roasting
7. To your food processor, add your peppers, garlic, miso, some chilli flakes for that kick, and the coconut milk and blend until smooth
8. Mix your lava with your cooked pasta and some pasta water et voila!
