I woke up one morning, wanting to treat my mother Antoinette with a breakfast. She has a very limited palette and she doesn't like cheese much. So I decided to make her a halloumi sandwich, paired with other stuff as well. She liked it as much as she likes me. The picture you see here, was taken after she ate the sandwich....

## Ingredients

* Sourdough bread
* 100 g Halloumi cheese
* 5 Cherry tomatoes
* Half a  peach or  hairless peach (nectarine)
* 2 Mint leaves
* 1 tbsp Mango Chutney
* Olive Oil 
* Salt


## Instructions

1. Wake up, and prep your bed, girl, you don't live in a hotel 
2. Have a CCC which translate into Café Clope Caca and start your day fresh
3. Ask your mom what she wants for breakfast, and whatever she says, do the opposite 
4. Slice two pieces of bread, oil them, and toast them until they're golden 
5. Now cut everything small small small (your halloumi, your peach and your tomatoes) 
6. In a bowl, mix the above with some salt, olive oil, the mango chutney and your mint and combine everything together
7. Lay your mixture on the toasted bread and let your mom enjoy!
