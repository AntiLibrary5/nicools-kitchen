Yes, it’s rice, but I went from making ghere to being HERE, on the queen of the queens’ blog, the master chef blog. Nikol is the bestest of the best. She’s definitely gonna make it big someday… but maybe not anytime soon, since she’s featuring a Sands’ Recipe. Still, she’s a great cook, you should totally trust her… just never when she says fi shway toum. I bully her all the time, so I guess I had to make it up to her at some point in life.
